# Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-
Graph theory is helpful to understand everything about networks and modeling real problems. Therefore, it is important to tackle every knowledge needed about graphs to understand how the Capacity Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) works. Then, it is explained how to solve the base problem, which in fact is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), by using the concepts of Hamiltonianâ€™s paths and circuits. A meta-heuristic method called Simulated Annealing (SA) will be used for its implementation, which is a method to find optimal Solutions to combinatorial optimization problems such as the VRP.

To this, it is presented a Python implementation of this SA algorithm to execute tests. With all this information in mind, a flexible distribution of zones is presented in relation to the number of vehicles available. The main characteristic of these zones is the non-intersection of the Hamiltonian paths presented by the route found with the proposed implementation. Finally, there will pose some strategies to tackle the CVRP considering new constraints in the implementation presented.
